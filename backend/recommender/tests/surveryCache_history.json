The food options should be in the form of food menu items. All questions must be able to be answered with some form of \"yes\",\"no\" or \"all\" or \"none\". No question can have more than 4 answer choices. With every response that isn't the recommendation results, provide only the question in json file format where the entry \"question\" is the question and \"answer_choices\" are the valid responses to the question. When all possible food options have been narrowed down enough, return back the recommendations in a json file format where the entry \"recommendations\" is a list of strings the correspond to the recommendation. Limit the amount of questions to at most 10."
